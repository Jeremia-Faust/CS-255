System Analysis and Design

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The owner of the DriverPass Liam asked us to create a web bases system that will teach student about the rules and regulations of driving. To prepare them they have the ability to take practice tests. The student will be able to buy packages to do on the road train with an instructor. They will have the ability to maintain their own scheduling, but the company employees will have the same ability to maintain student accounts. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a good job on the different diagrams. They explain the different processes visually and allow you to see any problems that you cannot see in a written 
document.  

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I did the business requirement documents a few weeks before system design document and the presentation. I would update some of the thing that had changed due to my 
understanding of the system improving.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The business requirements document was a great place to start to on breaking down what the requirements are. By breaking everything down we can take all the parts that are required then putting them back together into a working system. It is very important to consider the need of the user at all time there may be things that they do not ever realize they need until you bring it up to them. If you do not consider their needs, they most likely will not use the system at all. I work in a manufacturing company and we have had three different software that were custom designed the second time was supposed to be an upgrade since the first system was outdated. Well, the system did not fulfill our needs and it turned out to be a multimillion-dollar problem. We had to scrap the new system and get a new one built from the ground up.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When approaching designing a system it starts with interviews and data collection. Then we dissect all the information to create a system diagrams and design documentations. It requires constant communication with the client to make sure you get all the requirements into the system.
